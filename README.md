# Kanban Board

**Work in progress.**

A fairly simple Kanban app written with Vue.js and Vuex. There is no backend currently, just a mocked up Javascript class.

Know issues:
- Firefox may stop sorting - it is an [issue on Sortable.js](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable/issues/1267) itself.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
